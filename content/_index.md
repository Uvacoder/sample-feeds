This website hosts a large number of Atom, RDF, and RSS sample feeds for use in testing feed parsing software or new aggregators. It provides both sample files from feed specifications as well as real-world examples of valid, semi-valid, and invalid feeds.

The [source code for this website is on GitHub](https://github.com/rowanmanning/sample-feeds), if you want to add new feeds then please follow the [instructions in the README](https://github.com/rowanmanning/sample-feeds#adding-new-feeds).

If some content you own has been added to this site and you'd like it to be removed, please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/rowanmanning/sample-feeds/issues) or [contact Rowan](mailto:info+sample-feeds@rowanmanning.com).
