You buy a fancy new PC, and everything runs smoothly at first. And then, slowly but surely, it starts to feel more sluggish. Every week or month, things take just a little longer to load, until your PC feels like it’s running Windows 1.0, not Windows 11. If this describes you, it’s probably about time you take a look at which apps are running at startup, and strip things down to the bare essentials. We’re here to help. There are multiple ways to prevent apps from loading as soon as you log in&#8230;<br /><br /><a href="https://thenextweb.com/news/disable-startup-apps-windows-11?utm_source=social&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=profeed">This story continues</a> at The Next Web<br /><br />Or just read more coverage about: <a href="https://thenextweb.com/topic/windows">Windows</a>

Musk has agreed to cap his Twitter stake at 14.9% during his stint on the board and for 90 days thereafter. His term is set to end in 2024. The Tesla tycoon’s existing 9.2% stake makes him the platform’s largest shareholder. If he wants to push it over 14.9%, he will have to relinquish his seat. The restriction applies to Musk as either the sole owner or as a member of a group —&#8230;<br /><br /><a href="https://thenextweb.com/news/elon-musk-appointment-to-twitter-board-reduces-takeover-threat?utm_source=social&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=profeed">This story continues</a> at The Next Web<br /><br />Or just read more coverage about: <a href="https://thenextweb.com/company/twitter-3">Twitter</a>

The new venture, called Equilibre Technologies, will employ algorithms to pick stocks and cryptocurrency. Up front: The stock market is a nebulous and challenging environment to try and “solve” with AI, but the team’s leadership appears more than up for the challenge. Martin Schmid, Rudolf Kadlec, and Matej Moravcik, the company’s founders, all worked together at IBM and DeepMind.

Russia is seeking to control the narrative by muffling dissent. Last month, the Kremlin blocked several social media platforms and threatened lengthy jail terms for spreading “false information” about the invasion. A series of domestic alternatives to American apps are now being promoted, from RuTube to Rossgram. Critics describe the latter as “absolute shit.” The next service that may require a Putin-approved replacement is Wikipedia. Regulators last week threatened to fine the site up to 4 million rubles (around $47,000) if it doesn’t remove “prohibited information” about the&#8230;<br /><br /><a href="https://thenextweb.com/news/web3-developers-building-decentralized-wikipedia-evade-russian-censorship?utm_source=social&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=profeed">This story continues</a> at The Next Web<br /><br />Or just read more coverage about: <a href="https://thenextweb.com/company/wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>

On paper, VanMoof is in with a good shot. Over the past couple of years, it raised $182 million (second only to Rad Power) and has emerged as, arguably, the most popular ebike brand. Or, at the very least, the most talked about company in the space — whether that’s good or bad.

Even though Earendel is 50 times the mass of the Sun, and millions of times brighter, we would not normally be able to see it. We can see it due to an alignment of the star with a large galaxy cluster in front of it whose gravity bends the light from the star to make it brighter and more focused – essentially creating a lens. Astronomers see into the deep past when we view distant objects. Light travels at a constant speed (3×10⁸&#8230;<br /><br /><a href="https://thenextweb.com/news/hubble-telescope-spotted-most-distant-star-ever?utm_source=social&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=profeed">This story continues</a> at The Next Web]]></description>

Gull-wing doors. Plutonium-powered time-travel capabilities. Yes, it’s the DeLorean. Turned into a pop-culture icon after the Back to the Future film franchise, this unique vehicle is coming back to life after 39 long years! And the best part? It’s being reborn as an EV! The DeLorean Motor Company (DMC) was originally established in 1973 by, yes, John DeLorean. Unfortunately, it declared bankruptcy in 1982, and was ultimately bought by Stephen Wynne in 1995. Since then, the DMC has been the largest parts supplier and restorer of vintage DeLorean vehicles.

And while the trend is a cause for concern, it’s not yet as bad as some people believe. But, the concerns still remain.  Recently a Redditor posted a short clip on a subreddit called r/Mildly Infuriating. The post depicted a tale of opting out of purchasing Audi’s tri-zone climate control (cooling and heating) in an SUV, but it still came with the sync button that a driver would use for temperature control.  https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2022/04/dc4ybhwb2yo81.mp4 Video credit: Reddit In short, the driver pushed the button, and a&#8230;<br /><br /><a href="https://thenextweb.com/news/a-blank-hvac-button-reveals-a-deeper-fear-about-ota-car-software?utm_source=social&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=profeed">This story continues</a> at The Next Web<br /><br />Or just read more coverage about: <a href="https://thenextweb.com/company/reddit">Reddit</a>

Now the company is extending to a new market with the release of the DJI Mic, a $329 wireless microphone system that takes a page out of Apple’s AirPods and other wireless earbuds. While the DJI Mic is far from the first compact wireless microphone system, it stands out with its AirPods-like case.
