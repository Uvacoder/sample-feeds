The best travel photos can bring us back to cherished memories of past trips, or even transport us to places we&#x2019;ve never experienced first-hand. But when it comes to travel photography, the truth is: while we all do it &#x2014; few do it well. &#xA0;So if you&#x2019;re looking to take your travel photography to the next level, you&#x2019;re in the right place. </p><p>We recently caught up with a few of our favourite travel photographers on Unsplash to chat about everything from their travel photography gear when travelling, to their top tips for the beginners out there.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/2022/03/gene-brutty-1v72hZmAeyY-unsplash--1-.jpg" width="2000" height="2369" loading="lazy" alt="How to elevate your travel photography" srcset="https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2022/03/gene-brutty-1v72hZmAeyY-unsplash--1-.jpg 600w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2022/03/gene-brutty-1v72hZmAeyY-unsplash--1-.jpg 1000w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2022/03/gene-brutty-1v72hZmAeyY-unsplash--1-.jpg 1600w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w2400/2022/03/gene-brutty-1v72hZmAeyY-unsplash--1-.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/2022/03/gene-brutty-U31cUL5VjIU-unsplash.jpg" width="2000" height="2514" loading="lazy" alt="How to elevate your travel photography" srcset="https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2022/03/gene-brutty-U31cUL5VjIU-unsplash.jpg 600w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2022/03/gene-brutty-U31cUL5VjIU-unsplash.jpg 1000w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2022/03/gene-brutty-U31cUL5VjIU-unsplash.jpg 1600w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w2400/2022/03/gene-brutty-U31cUL5VjIU-unsplash.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div><figcaption><a href="https://unsplash.com/@genebrut">Gene Brutty</a></figcaption></figure><h3 id="but-first-why-travel-photography">But first, why travel photography?</h3><p>For Unsplash contributor <a href="https://unsplash.com/@genebrut" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener"><strong>Gene Brutty</strong></a>, travel photography is less about the excitement of being in a new place, and more about capturing &#x201C;another person&#x2019;s &#x2018;normal&#x2019;.&#x201D; Gene says, &#x201C;Typical and common tourist attractions often misrepresent the essence of a city or town.

Schwarz</a></figcaption></figure><h3 id="the-challenges-of-travel-photography">The challenges of travel photography</h3><p>For most, the challenge (and beauty) of travel photography revolves around shooting unfamiliar places. This is why <strong>Mehmet</strong> believes the most important part to travel photography is studying the destination beforehand and bringing the right equipment. He says, &#x201C;Do a preliminary study of the region to be travelled and examine the photos taken before about that region. Pre-design the compositions and set up the equipment.&#x201D;</p><p>While it often pays to prepare and plan, <strong>Ryunosuke</strong> admits, &#x201C;It won&#x2019;t always be possible to take the photos you envision.&#x201D; But often, these challenges can become ways to capture new places in unique ways. On a past trip to Vancouver,</p><p><strong>Ryunosuke</strong> recounts: &#x201C;It rained the entire time I was there. However, I used the puddles that appeared to take some nice reflection photography. Even unexpected moments like that can make travel photography even more enjoyable depending on your way of thinking.&#x201D;</p><h3 id="top-tips-for-beginners-looking-to-improve-their-travel-photos">Top tips for beginners looking to improve their travel photos</h3><p><strong>Daniel&#x2019;s</strong> top tip? Know your camera. He warns, &#x201C;Don&#x2019;t let the camera occupy the moments. Know your equipment so you don&#x2019;t waste time on technical stuff.&#x201C; Then, it all comes down to patience. Remember that &#x201C;you are not in a studio, you have to wait until the clouds or sun are at a place you want them to be.&#x201D;</p><p>With <strong>Gene</strong>, it&#x2019;s simple: <em>Walk. &#x201C;</em>Walk everywhere if possible. Walk aimlessly, walk slowly, take the long way on purpose - the unexpected moments you will uncover by doing this will be better than any photo you plan for.&#x201D;</p><p>For <strong>Ryunosuke</strong>, it&#x2019;s all about experimenting with different perspectives. &#x201C;Try boldly moving &#xA0;closer or further away. Play around with extreme low or high angles or from directly below or above your subject without relying solely on the camera&apos;s lens zoom. Then, it will be able to take own special or unique travel photography that are different from those than always.&#x201D;</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/2022/03/ryunosuke-kikuno-ux_7HA7IgJ0-unsplash.jpg" width="2000" height="3006" loading="lazy" alt="How to elevate your travel photography" srcset="https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2022/03/ryunosuke-kikuno-ux_7HA7IgJ0-unsplash.jpg 600w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2022/03/ryunosuke-kikuno-ux_7HA7IgJ0-unsplash.jpg 1000w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2022/03/ryunosuke-kikuno-ux_7HA7IgJ0-unsplash.jpg 1600w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w2400/2022/03/ryunosuke-kikuno-ux_7HA7IgJ0-unsplash.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/2022/03/ryunosuke-kikuno-XCzB-Oheuss-unsplash.jpg" width="2000" height="3006" loading="lazy" alt="How to elevate your travel photography" srcset="https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2022/03/ryunosuke-kikuno-XCzB-Oheuss-unsplash.jpg 600w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2022/03/ryunosuke-kikuno-XCzB-Oheuss-unsplash.jpg 1000w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2022/03/ryunosuke-kikuno-XCzB-Oheuss-unsplash.jpg 1600w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w2400/2022/03/ryunosuke-kikuno-XCzB-Oheuss-unsplash.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div><figcaption><a href="https://unsplash.com/@ryunosuke_kikuno">Ryunosuke Kikuno</a></figcaption></figure><h3 id="fondest-photographs-from-past-travels">Fondest photographs from past travels</h3><p>A photograph from <strong>Gene&#x2019;s</strong> travels in Mumbai continues to stick with him, even now.

And while the water crisis is huge, we&#x2019;re optimistic. We know how to solve the problem, and we make progress every day thanks to the help of local partners and generous supporters. If we work together, we believe everyone will have access to life&#x2019;s most basic need within our lifetime.&#x201D; <br>&#x2014; charity: water</blockquote><p>This year, they&#x2019;ve put together an awareness campaign called <em><strong><a href="https://cwtr.org/3IwuxyC">The Color of Dirty Water</a></strong></em> to help paint a picture of the real color of water that too many people around the world drink today. There is water in countries where they work that is milky gray, mustard yellow, and forest green.

And even if they look fine at first glance, give your screens a good clean as your camera will pick up on <em>everything</em>. To clean my screen, I typically use the cloths you get to clean your glasses. If that doesn&#x2019;t work, I use screen wipes designed for your digital screens to get off stubborn grime.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/2022/03/image.png" class="kg-image" alt="Back to Basics: How to shoot screens" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="857" srcset="https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2022/03/image.png 600w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2022/03/image.png 1000w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/2022/03/image.png 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><h3 id="tip-2-set-the-scene">Tip 2: Set the scene</h3><p>Whether you&#x2019;re shooting your phone screen or your desktop monitor &#x2014; pay attention to what else will make it into the frame.

That can be avoided by shooting LCD screens in soft natural light. Artificial lighting will inevitably give off more glare &#x2014; but if natural lighting isn&#x2019;t available, be sure you experiment with the angle of your phone and camera. And make sure your phone never has direct light hitting it to avoid unwanted glare. The secret to getting great photos of your screens is truly all about getting the right angle.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/2022/03/Kjwnfkwt.jpeg" width="1280" height="879" loading="lazy" alt="Back to Basics: How to shoot screens" srcset="https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2022/03/Kjwnfkwt.jpeg 600w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2022/03/Kjwnfkwt.jpeg 1000w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/2022/03/Kjwnfkwt.jpeg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/2022/03/SENTN2UO.jpeg" width="1280" height="853" loading="lazy" alt="Back to Basics: How to shoot screens" srcset="https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2022/03/SENTN2UO.jpeg 600w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2022/03/SENTN2UO.jpeg 1000w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/2022/03/SENTN2UO.jpeg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></div></div></div><figcaption>Play with the angle of the camera or phone so that the screen is showing minimal shadows and glare for the shot.</figcaption></figure><h3 id="tip-4-try-a-small-aperture">Tip 4: Try a small aperture </h3><p>Use a small aperture so the whole screen is in focus. If you&apos;re holding your phone in your hand, you&#x2019;ll be able to retain a good depth of field while keeping the phone as the main subject. If you&#x2019;re shooting your desktop, I typically make sure the screen isn&#x2019;t too close to my camera, and experiment with the angles so you can minimize reflections and have a nice depth of field in the background.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/2022/03/RaPmJKjU.png" width="687" height="1030" loading="lazy" alt="Back to Basics: How to shoot screens" srcset="https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2022/03/RaPmJKjU.png 600w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/2022/03/RaPmJKjU.png 687w"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/2022/03/ZinZZqxw.png" width="687" height="1031" loading="lazy" alt="Back to Basics: How to shoot screens" srcset="https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2022/03/ZinZZqxw.png 600w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/2022/03/ZinZZqxw.png 687w"></div></div></div><figcaption>Featuring: <a href="https://unsplash.com/@techdailyca">Tech Daily</a> and <a href="https://unsplash.com/@ingoodhands">Good Faces Agency</a></figcaption></figure><h3 id="tip-5-turn-down-screen-brightness">Tip 5: Turn down screen brightness </h3><p>To avoid overexposing your shots, turn down your screen brightness accordingly.

Shoot a few photos in dark mode. </p><h3 id="tip-6-minimize-reflections">Tip 6: Minimize reflections </h3><p>While some reflections are okay, others can feel like they detract from the final image. To reduce jarring reflections, you can hold a dark reflector between your light source and your screen.

Everyone has the flexibility of working however they like, whenever they like. No set hours, no time tracking, unlimited vacations (it actually is true). We were remote-friendly before it was cool. We believe people know best how and when to do their best work.

One song that I listened to a lot while building Unsplash is &#x201C;The Other Side Of Paradise&#x201D; from Glass animals.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe style="border-radius: 12px" width="100%" height="80" title="Spotify Embed: The Other Side Of Paradise" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/0rRjGruFonCGOt0S5zAJNQ?si=e7a8cb250b404f63&amp;utm_source=oembed"></iframe></figure><h3 id="what-do-you-do-when-you-aren%E2%80%99t-working-on-unsplash">What do you do when you aren&#x2019;t working on Unsplash? </h3><p>Good question.

He was pushing for me to upload my work on Unsplash, as he thought it would be &#x2018;the new up and coming&#x2019; platform for photographers, and I would not only fit well with their vision and style, but would benefit from it &#x2014; and boy was he right. </p><p>At a first glance, it all looked very intimidating and I did not feel confident enough to upload any pictures. &#xA0;I did however upload 10 of my best pictures from our recent ski trip to get my husband off my back &#x2014; the next day I received a notification on Instagram that Unsplash tagged me in a post. I remember the excitement like it was yesterday, I felt so seen and validated, to have them share one of my pictures when I didn&#x2019;t think that my work would be of any use. There were tears of course.</p><p>It was the first platform that interacted with you as a user, it had that human factor, it made you feel celebrated rather than being used - this is number one reason why I continued uploading and being part of this community.&quot;</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/2021/12/toa-heftiba-D_mFA0GZuAs-unsplash.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Behind 1 Billion: Toa Heftiba" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="2797" srcset="https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/12/toa-heftiba-D_mFA0GZuAs-unsplash.jpg 600w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2021/12/toa-heftiba-D_mFA0GZuAs-unsplash.jpg 1000w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2021/12/toa-heftiba-D_mFA0GZuAs-unsplash.jpg 1600w, https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/size/w2400/2021/12/toa-heftiba-D_mFA0GZuAs-unsplash.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Toa&apos;s first upload.</figcaption></figure><h3 id="how-do-you-feel-your-photography-has-grown-since-you-started-out-on-unsplash">How do you feel your photography has grown since you started out on Unsplash?</h3><p>&quot;I think I grew in confidence the most, which reflects in my work. Being able to take part in bigger projects, like shooting for &#x2018;Samsung&#x2019;, and &#x2018;Boxed Water is Better&#x2019; pushed me out of my comfort zone and stretched my limits.
